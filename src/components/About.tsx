  "A dedicated Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications using JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. I have worked on commercial projects including an online ecommerce platform, a real-money gaming site (like Stake), and parts of a social media app. I have integrated REST APIs, WebSockets (for live games), Redis (for caching), and authentication systems. Iâ€™ve also managed payments, implemented cheat detection, used logging tools, and deployed backends on Render and VPS using PuTTY. In my team role, I have led junior developers, reviewed code, fixed bugs, and guided them through project tasks.";
